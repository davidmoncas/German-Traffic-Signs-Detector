Kiwi Campus Inc, the biggest delivery company with robots in Sillicon Valley presented this challenge of robotics and machine learning. This repository is my solution to the challenge of Machine Learning.

## Description of the challenge

The machine learning challenge consist in create, train and test three image classification models: 

- Model 1: A logistic regression model using only Scikit-learn.
- Model 2: A logistic regression model using only Tensorflow
- Model 3: A convolutional neural netwroks following this paper: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-01a.pdf Using only tensorflow

For this three task, we have to use a Dataset called German Traffic Signs Dataset ( http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsdb&subsection=dataset ) , downloading and preparing the data using code is also part of the challenge.

## My solution

I could only develop the first two models, both are functional, capable of infer new images. I obtained accuracies arround (75%-85%).
